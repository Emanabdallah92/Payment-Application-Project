# Payment-Application-Project

## Project Description
Payment system is available everywhere and used by everyone globally. In this project we tried to simulate the real process of payment by asking for the credit card
data and checking with the server, whether it is found in the database or not. Then, asking for the transaction amount and comparing it with the available balance owned 
by the credit card owner. Most importantly, this simulation make sure to check whether tha card is stolen and is it fake.
The project can be divided to 4 main modules: Card, Transaction, Server and Application. THe card module is responsible for all the card data. The transaction is
responsible for all the transaction data. The server is responsible for the saved data base and for taking both the transaction data and the card date to check for
credibility and for the available balance then give the customer or the user a respond, whether the transaction is approved or decline and also state the reason for being 
declined.
