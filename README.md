# Payment-Application-Project

## Project Description
The payment system is available everywhere and used by everyone globally. In this project, we tried to simulate the real process of payment by asking for the credit card data and checking with the server, whether it is found in the database or not. Then, ask for the transaction amount and compare it with the available balance owned by the credit card owner. Most importantly, this simulation makes sure to check whether the card is stolen and if is it fake. The project can be divided into 4 main modules: Card, Transaction, Server and Application. The card module is responsible for all the card data. The transaction is responsible for all the transaction data. The server is responsible for the saved database and for taking both the transaction data and the card date to check for credibility and for the available balance then give the customer or the user a response, whether the transaction is approved or declined and also states the reason for being declined.
